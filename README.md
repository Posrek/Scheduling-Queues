# Scheduling-Queues

Write a simulation to study one of the problems discussed in the chapter. For example, you could
write a simulation for a queue that uses predicted service times, and use it to explore how the
service time distribution and the quality of the prediction affect the average time spent waiting
in the queue. Or you could implement an Count-Min sketch and simulate a predictor for heavy
hitter elements, and use it to explore how the accuracy of the sketch improves with the quality of
the prediction or varies with how skewed the frequency distribution of items is. Your simulation
can use an actual learned function as a predictor, or you could use a synthetic prediction (by for
example adding noise in some speciffed way to the ground truth to obtain a prediction).
